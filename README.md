Designed, developed and deployed a full stack e-commerce web application featuring a Node.js backend with an express server and Stripe integration for payment processing.

I designed this application to be easily templated, increasing reusaability.

The front end was designed to function similarly to a Single Page Application, creating a friendly and fluid user experience.

Directions for testing Stripe Integration:
  --> If you would like to test the Stripe integration, feel free to load the shopping cart with items and then use the following test cards to checkout. Do not input real credit card information!
  -Card for success: 4242 4242 4242 4242 exp 12/25 CVC 123
  -Card for failure (generic decline): 4000 0000 0000 0002 exp 12/25 CVC 123
